   data format called <xref id="x2" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Information_Typing_Architecture" format="html" scope="external">DITA</xref>. There are a number of very cool features about DITA, but for our
   purposes today the most important is topic-based authoring.</p>
  <p id="x3">Instead of authoring a book, or a blog post, or a FAQ, you author individual topics. These
   topics are intended to be concise and cover a single idea. Then, to produce a larger document,
   you organize these topics together into a map.</p>
