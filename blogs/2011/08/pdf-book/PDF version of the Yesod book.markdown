The PDF is [available for immediate download](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.snoyman.com/yesodbook/Yesod+Web+Framework+Book+2011-07-31.pdf). It has an ugly styling, hasn't been checked much, and probably has a bunch of other problems, but it's there.

For those interested in the mechanics behind this: the book is written in an XML format called DITA. This site stores the book as DITA as well. I just added a feature to export the book contents into a ZIP file, which allows me to use existing DITA solutions for PDF creation.

Next step: write some nice Haskell-based DITA tools and try to get some automatic PDF generation in place.
