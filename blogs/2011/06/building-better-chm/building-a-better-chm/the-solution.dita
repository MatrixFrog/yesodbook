  <p id="x1">The solution we came up with is providing a single executable that embeds a server (Warp) and
   the static files, and launches a browser to view them. This is a natural extension of Yesod in
   general, where Hamlet and family are compiled directly into our executables. This approach works
   fairly well, but required some extra work.</p>
