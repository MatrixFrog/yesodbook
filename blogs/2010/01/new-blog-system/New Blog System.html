<p>I decided I would like to streamline <a href="http://www.snoyman.com/">my domain name</a> by making the homepage my blog. I've always considered Wordpress to be a temporary solution as it is too heavy for my needs, so I finally decided to bite the bullet and make <a href="http://github.com/snoyberg/bloggy">my own blog system</a>.</p>
<p>It's nothing fancy, but it allows me to make my blog posts in Vim and track them with Git, so I consider it a significant improvement to my wordflow.</p>
<p>I decided to outsource comments to <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>; I don't have much experience with them, so I wouldn't mind hearing any feedback on it.</p>
<p>And as you might guess, it's built on <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/code.html">Yesod Web Framework</a>. This blog was the final project in my queue before tidying up Yesod for its first release. Currently, it has some major space leaks, some of which come from <a href="http://github.com/snoyberg/yaml/tree/data-object-yaml">underlying libraries</a>. Once those are addressed, I'll try to do some basic code clean-up, document a bit more and release!</p>
<p>Also, expect this blog to contain a significant increase in web development discussions as I move from developing a web framework to <a href="http://www.yesodweb.com/">developing web sites</a>.</p>
