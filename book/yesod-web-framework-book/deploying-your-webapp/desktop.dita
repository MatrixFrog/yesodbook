This backend combines Warp and QtWebkit to create an executable that a user simply double-clicks. This can be a convenient way to provide an offline version of your application.</p><p id="desktop2">One of the very nice conveniences of Yesod for this is that your templates are all compiled into the executable, and thus do not need to be distributed with your application. Static files do, however.</p><note id="x2">Earlier versions of Yesod allowed for embedding of static files in the executable as well. This is not a particularly complicated feature to implement, and if there is demand, can be added back in the future.</note></conbody></concept>
