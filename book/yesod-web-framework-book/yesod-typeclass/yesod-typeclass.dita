So far, we've only seen the approot method, with the cryptic definition <codeph id="x1">approot _ = ""</codeph>, and defaultLayout. In this chapter, we'll explore the meaning of the approot method, along with many other methods in the Yesod typeclass.</p><p id="i2">The Yesod typeclass gives us a central place for defining settings for our application. Excluding the approot method, everything else has a default definition which is usually the right thing. But in order to build a powerful, customized application, you'll usually end up overriding at least a few of these methods.</p></conbody></concept>
