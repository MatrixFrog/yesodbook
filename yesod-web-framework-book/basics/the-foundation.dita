<concept id="the-foundation"><title>The Foundation</title><conbody><p id="foundation1">The word "HelloWorld" shows up on lines 4, 6, 10 and 15, yet the datatype doesn't seem to actually do anything important. In fact, this seemingly irrelevant piece of code is central to how Yesod works. Each Yesod application has a single datatype, referred to as its <term id="x1">foundation</term>.</p><p id="foundation2">Line 4 of our example defines this simple datatype. Line 6 does something a bit more interesting: it associates the routing rule we define on line 7 with this datatype. Each foundation <i id="x2">must</i> be an instance of the Yesod typeclass; we do this on line 10. We'll get into much more detail on the Yesod typeclass and the approot method in <xref id="x3" href="../../yesod-web-framework-book/yesod-typeclass/yesod-typeclass.dita">the Yesod typeclass chapter</xref>.</p><note id="x4" type="other" othertype="advanced"><p id="foundation3">By the way, the word Yesod (יסוד) means <i id="x5">foundation</i> in Hebrew.</p></note></conbody></concept>
