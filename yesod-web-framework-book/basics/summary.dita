<concept id="summary"><title>Summary</title><conbody><p id="summary1">Every Yesod application is built around a foundation datatype. We associate some resources with said datatype and define some handler functions, and Yesod handles all of the routing. These resources are also data constructors, which lets us have type-safe URLs.</p><p id="summary2">By being built on top of WAI, Yesod applications can run with a number of different backends. warpDebug is an easy way to get started, as it's included with Yesod. For rapid development, wai-handler-devel is a good choice. And when you're ready to move to production, there are high-performance options like Warp and FastCGI.</p></conbody></concept>
