<concept id="routing"><title>Routing</title><conbody><p id="routing1">Like most modern web frameworks, Yesod follows a <xref id="x1" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Controller_pattern" scope="external" format="html">front controller pattern</xref>. This means that every request to a Yesod application enters at the same point and is routed from there. As a contrast, in systems like PHP and ASP you often times create a number of different files, and the web server automatically directs requests to the relevant file.</p><p id="routing2">Lines 6 through 8 set up this routing system. We see our only <term id="x2">resource</term> defined on line 7. We'll give full details of the syntax later, but this line creates a resource named HomeR, which accepts GET requests at the root (/) of our application.</p><p id="routing3">Yesod sees this resource declaration, and determines to call the getHomeR <term id="x3">handler function</term> whenever it receives a request for HomeR. The function name follows the simple pattern of request method, in lowercase, followed by the resource name.</p></conbody></concept>
