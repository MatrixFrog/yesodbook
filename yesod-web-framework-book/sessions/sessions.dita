            storing state about an interaction with a client. However, it is
            sometimes unavoidable. Features like shopping carts are the classic
            example, but other more mundane interactions like proper login
            handling can be greatly enhanced by proper usage of sessions.</p><p id="i2">This chapter will describe how Yesod stores session data,
            how you can access this data, and some special functions to help
            you make the most of sessions.</p></conbody></concept>
