Besides approot, they are all optional. By using built-in Yesod constructs like defaultLayout and getMessage, you'll get a consistent look-and-feel throughout your site, including pages automatically generated by Yesod such as error pages and authentication.</p><p id="s2">We haven't covered all the methods in the Yesod typeclass in this chapter. Some of them relate to topics we have not yet covered (such as authentication), and will be discussed in those chapters. For a full listing of methods available, you should always consult the Haddock documentation.</p></conbody></concept>
