 <title>Smarter Static Files</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Google recommends an important optimization: <xref
    href="http://code.google.com/speed/page-speed/docs/request.html#ServeFromCookielessDomain"
    format="html" scope="external">serve static files from a separate domain</xref>. The advantage
   to this approach is that cookies set on your main domain are not sent when retrieving static
   files, thus saving on a bit of bandwidth.</p>
  <p>To facilitate this, we have the <codeph>urlRenderOverride</codeph> method. This method
   intercepts the normal URL rendering and sets a special value for some routes. For example, the
   scaffolding defines this method as:</p>
  <codeblock outputclass="haskell">    urlRenderOverride y (StaticR s) =
        Just $ uncurry (joinPath y (Settings.staticRoot $ settings y)) $ renderRoute s
    urlRenderOverride _ _ = Nothing</codeblock>
  <p>This means that static routes are served from a special static root, which you can configure to
   be a different domain. This is a great example of the power and flexibility of type-safe URLs:
   with a single line of code you're able to change the rendering of static routes throughout all of
   your handlers.</p>
