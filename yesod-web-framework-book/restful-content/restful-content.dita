<concept id="restful-content"><title>RESTful Content</title><conbody><p id="i1">One of the stories from the early days of the web is how search engines wiped out entire websites. When dynamic web sites were still a new concept, developers didn't appreciate the difference between a GET and POST request. As a result, they created pages- accessed with the GET method- that would delete pages. When search engines started crawling these sites, they could wipe out all the content.</p><p id="i2">If these web developers had followed the HTTP spec properly, this would not have happened. A GET request is supposed to cause no side effects (you know, like wiping out a site). Recently, there has been a move in web development called Representational State Transfer, also known as REST. This chapter describes the RESTful features in Yesod and how you can use them to create more robust web applications.</p></conbody></concept>
